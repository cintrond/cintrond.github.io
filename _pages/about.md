Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow at [Evidence for Action](https://www.evidenceforaction.org/). I received my PhD in educational psychology with a concentration in research methods, reasurement, and evaluation from the Neag School of Education at the University of Connecticut. I earned a EdM in measurement and evaluation and MS in applied statistics from Teachers College at Columbia. In the past, I have held professional positions at the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research, the National Institute for Early Education Research, and New Visions for Public Schools. These experiences helped shape my understanding of research methodology and its uses. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
