I am a PhD student in the Research Methods, Measurement, and Evaluation (RMME) program in the Department of Educational Psychology at the Neag School of Education. In the past, I have held professional positions at the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research, the National Institute for Early Education Research, and New Visions for Public Schools. These experiences helped shape my understanding of research methodology and its uses. I was raised in the Mountain State. I enjoy hiking, white-water rafting, and traveling.
