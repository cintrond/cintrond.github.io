This is a blog post commemorating my new website. I decided to go with this github pages template by [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) as it offers pretty versatile editing with markdown while also having a simple but nice interface. I will attempt to blog here but we will see how that goes!
