This study provides the results of a two-year follow-up evaluation on the influence of an undergraduate living and learning community (LLC) on Black male achievement at a Primarily White Institution (PWI). Two-year follow-up survival and latent growth curve analysis results provide evidence that the LLC group had higher gains in retention and grade point average than two control groups.
